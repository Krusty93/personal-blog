# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Hugo-based personal blog.

## Changes Made

### Created
- `layouts/partials/custom_head.html` - Added Vercel Web Analytics tracking script

## Implementation Details

The Hugo theme (hugo-bearblog) provides a `custom_head.html` partial that is included in the base template's `<head>` section. This is the standard Hugo way to inject custom code into the site's HTML.

I created `layouts/partials/custom_head.html` with the Vercel Web Analytics script as documented for HTML sites:

```html
<!-- Vercel Web Analytics -->
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

## Verification

- Successfully built the site using `hugo --gc --minify`
- Verified that the analytics script is properly included in all generated HTML pages
- The script is included in the `<head>` section of every page on the site

## Notes

- For Hugo sites, no npm packages are needed since we use the direct HTML script approach
- The script will automatically track page views once the site is deployed to Vercel
- After enabling Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard, the `/_vercel/insights/*` routes will be available
- No route detection is included with this implementation (as noted in the HTML documentation), but page views will still be tracked

## Next Steps for User

1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to the project dashboard
   - Click the "Analytics" tab
   - Click "Enable"

2. Deploy the site to Vercel (the analytics will start working after deployment)

3. After deployment, verify in the browser's Network tab that requests are being made to `/_vercel/insights/view`
