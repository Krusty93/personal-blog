Writing helps personal development, so I've started this blog.

## Hello, I'm Andrea Grillo

...another software engineering field guy. I live in Milan (Italy), and here I talk about experiences, tech, personal life, maybe passions and whatever I can think of.

I write primarily for myself, but hopefully you may find something interesting for you as well.

Welcome!
