Since the end of the Covid era, I've been lucky enough to travel at least once per year to exotic locations for pleasure. I recall Cuba in particular, a place where I lost my heart. I fell in love with people and their lifestyle, and I found their history through slavery, colonialism, and communism fascinating, although dramatic and sad. I really admire Cuban people, how they manage dramatic events and deal with the hard reality.

As I was preparing to the honeymoon trip to Viet Nam, I hoped to repeat the Cuban experience and to emotionally connect to destination country. Then I realized it was more a desire but all, as it's difficult to feel the same emotions twice. Moreover, Viet Nam deserved its own identity, without any shadow.

This isn't a blog about trips, so I will not dig into each place I visited. The trip started from Ha Noi at the north, then I moved across the entire country visiting Nin Binh, Hue, Hoi An, Ke Ga Bay, Sa Dec and finally Ho Chi Minh City, in 12 days.
They're a lot, don't they?

Ha Noi is an interesting city. It's huge but does not have any underground service or anything which resembles public transport, on the surface included. Dirty air goes up through the nostrils, the tongue, the hair, as I have never seen in my life. People throw things on the ground, traffic is massive, farmers burn plastic in the countryside, western brands run factories. Effects are immediately visible. I’ve seen an abnormal amount of people with cough and cold, especially outdoor workers. But it’s not just a Vietnamese issue: damage to biodiversity (Viet Nam is one of the richest countries in the world), oceans and air involve everyone. As a European, I’m used to pose attention to my behaviour, towards energy consumption and waste. Meanwhile, in Viet Nam I haven’t seen any sensitivity about the issue from authorities. On the contrary, they are worried about the development pace decrease forecasted in the next 15 years due to population getting older. They’re rushing, they must find economic stability before letting go and relaxing and put in place social and environment measures. As they will never suffer from those decisions, it’s others’ problem.

Doesn’t it have any sense? No, in some measure the same applies to western countries too, after all.

Going forward, I found Viet Name still fascinating, including Ha Noi. Train street, random alleys, communism propaganda, markets, streets filled with mopeds make you curious to discover the next corner, the next shop, the next pagoda. It was all beautiful, light years away from western culture.

Their attention to the body care also caught my eye. There are so many stores, often open at night and it’s a service offered by many hotels as well. I tried few, and I enjoyed the experience. Before starting, tea with herbs and eastern aromas is offered. You drink while your muscles relax, tension goes away, and minute after minute you settle into comfort, understanding that _you are not wasting time, but finding it for yourself_. After months of hard work, it’s difficult to realize.
