While lying down on one of the sleeping buses in the south of Viet Nam, the dear and old idea of running a personal blog knocked again to my mind.

> why should I run a blog?
> ...
> is it a waste of time?
> is it just a romantic idea which will end up in nothing concrete?
> do I have topics to talk about?
> ...
> and especially: do I have time to regularly write?

Since that day I thought a lot about the answers, but the only answer I could come up with was:

> just write for yourself: let thoughts flow, improve your writing skill while letting thoughts flowing

So I did. When I came back home from Viet Nam less than a week later, I opened VS Code, searched online for a nice theme, bought the domain, and the blog was spun up. In less than a day and with just $3, I now have a blog, a public personal space to write and do whatever I want. Hopefully, it'll help me improve my writing skills or serve as an outlet. If it doesn't, I will lose three dollars (actually €2.60), and no one will remember it.

I don't know if I'll have the time, motivation or consistency to write regularly, but who cares after all? I owe nothing to anyone.

Anyway, despite that not being my goal, I hope you'll find food for thought here.

And you, yes, the reader. Why don't you start your own blog? It costs nothing.
