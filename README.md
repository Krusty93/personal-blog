# Personal Blog

Running a personal blog can be useful for several reasons. Telling your own story, developing writing abilities, digging topics you’re interested in and more.

This repository contains my personal blog ([krusty.blog](https://krusty.blog)). It is developed by using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [BearBlog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) theme. Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
